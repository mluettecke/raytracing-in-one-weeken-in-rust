# Raytracing in a weekend (in rust)

An experiment to implement [Raytracing in a weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by [Peter Shirley](https://github.com/petershirley).

This is mostly a learning experience for me since I am a rust beginner. The code here could offend you.
